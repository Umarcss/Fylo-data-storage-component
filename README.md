### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Raleway)
- Font Awesome

### What I learned

This project was a good exercise in building a responsive component with a focus on CSS layout techniques like Flexbox. I also gained more experience with managing different background images for mobile and desktop views, as well as handling font imports from Google Fonts and icons from Font Awesome.

### Continued development

In future projects, I'll continue to focus on:

- Advanced CSS techniques for more complex layouts and animations.
- Improving accessibility features.
- Exploring JavaScript for interactive elements and dynamic content.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used for importing the Raleway typeface.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For easy icon integration.
